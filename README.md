This project focuses on developing a text summarization system using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It combines extractive and abstractive summarization techniques, leveraging models like BERT and GPT-3 to generate high-quality summaries. The workflow includes preprocessing, tokenization, and semantic analysis to create concise and informative outputs. The system supports user customization and batch processing, and it integrates automated evaluation metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU. Additionally, the project demonstrates deployment using CI/CD pipelines on AWS, ensuring scalable and efficient summarization for various domains.
